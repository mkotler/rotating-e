# Rotating E

This application monitors for Microsoft Outlook new emails on Windows and when one arrives it displays a rotating e (akin to a screen saver).  

The rotating e is modeled as a separate Unity application that is shown/hidden.  

## Building and running the Application
1. Clone this repo locally
2. Open in vscode or your favorite IDE
3. Build the application
4. Copy the Unity folder to the same location as RotatingEOverlay.exe (e.g., RotatingEOverlay/bin/Debug/net9.0-windows/)
5. Make sure to install the .NET Desktop Runtime which matches the version in RotatingEOverlay.csproj.  If it has not changed from v9 then you can get it from (Download .NET 9.0 Desktop Runtime)[https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-9.0.8-windows-x64-installer].
